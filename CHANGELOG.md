# Changelog

All notable changes to IZI SIPREC will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- **Azure SAS-Token Authentication**: Azure Blob recording storage can now authenticate with a
  container-scoped SAS token via `RECORDING_STORAGE_AZURE_SAS_TOKEN`. This is the recommended,
  least-privilege method — a SAS token can be limited to a single container with create/write
  permissions and an expiry, unlike an account key which grants full access to the entire
  storage account. See `docs/configuration.md` → "Azure Blob Storage Authentication".
- **Azure Auth Validation**: Startup validation ensures exactly one Azure auth method is
  configured when Azure storage is enabled, and logs a warning when the account key is used.

### Changed
- **Azure SDK Migration**: Replaced the deprecated `github.com/Azure/azure-storage-blob-go`
  (v0.15.0, end-of-life) with the modern `github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/storage/azblob`.
  Blob operations now use the client-based API. Existing deployments using
  `RECORDING_STORAGE_AZURE_ACCESS_KEY` continue to work unchanged.

### Removed
- Dependencies `github.com/Azure/azure-storage-blob-go` and `github.com/Azure/azure-pipeline-go`.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-06-12

### Security
- **Removed Committed Encryption Key**: Deleted an encryption key file that had been committed to the repository
- **Hardened .gitignore**: Keys, certificates, local environment files, and build artifacts are now excluded from version control

### Added
- **Async STT Job API**: Queued transcription jobs exposed via `/api/stt/submit`, `/api/stt/jobs`, `/api/stt/jobs/{id}`, `/api/stt/stats`, `/api/stt/metrics`, and `/api/stt/queue/purge`
- **Configuration API**: Hot-reload management endpoints at `/api/config`, `/api/config/validate`, `/api/config/reload`, and `/api/config/reload/status`
- **RBAC Enforcement**: Optional role-based access control for HTTP API endpoints, enabled via `AUTH_RBAC_ENABLED=true` (requires authentication and database persistence)
- **SMTP Email Alerting**: The alerting email channel now delivers real SMTP mail with `auto`, `implicit` (SMTPS), `starttls`, and `none` TLS modes
- **Alert Delivery Metrics**: Notification channels report real delivery success/failure metrics
- **Encryption Key Backup/Restore**: Encryption keys can be exported to and restored from password-protected backups
- **AWS Secrets Manager Lookup**: Provider credentials can be resolved from AWS Secrets Manager
- **DNS & Load Balancer Failover**: Route 53 and GCP DNS failover plus GCP load balancer failover support in the backup/disaster-recovery subsystem

### Fixed
- **STUN Client RFC 5389 Compliance**: External IP discovery now builds and parses STUN messages per RFC 5389
- **Hot-Reload Deep Copy**: Configuration hot-reload performs a proper deep copy of the active configuration, preventing shared-state mutation between reloads

### Removed
- Roughly 850 dead/unused functions across the codebase
- Stale test reports, planning notes, ad-hoc test scripts, and scenario files from the repository root

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Per-Stream G.729 Decoder**: Each RTP stream now has its own dedicated G.729 decoder instance
  - Eliminates cross-call state leakage and race conditions from shared decoder pool
  - Decoder state is properly isolated per goroutine for thread safety
  - Added `ConcealPackets()` method for proper PLC that advances decoder state

- **SSRC Validation & Locking**: First RTP packet locks the expected SSRC for the stream
  - Packets with mismatched SSRC are dropped to prevent stale traffic from port reuse
  - Protects against cross-talk from delayed packets on recycled ports
  - Per-stream mismatch counters logged at stream end for diagnostics

- **SSRC Correction Mechanism**: Automatic SSRC switching when the locked SSRC goes silent
  - Handles "first-packet poisoning" after restart when stale packet locks wrong SSRC
  - Handles "silent SSRC change" when SBC changes SSRC during hold/unhold without signaling
  - Safety guards: requires 50+ packets from alternate SSRC AND 30+ consecutive non-locked packets
  - Blocked during hold state or RTP suspended state to prevent accepting stale traffic

- **Port Allocation Cooldown**: Recently freed ports are avoided to prevent stale RTP crosstalk
  - Fresh (never-used) ports preferred over recently released ports
  - Cooldown ports used as fallback only when all fresh ports are exhausted
  - Prevents new calls from receiving delayed packets from previous calls

- **SIPREC Forwarder Resilience**: SIPREC forwarders now survive RTP timeout instead of terminating
  - Enter `RTPSuspended` state when RTP times out (SBC stopped RTP without signaling)
  - Wait for BYE signal from SIP layer for proper cleanup
  - SSRC correction blocked during suspended state to prevent accepting stale traffic

- **ResetRemoteSSRC API**: SIP signaling events (re-INVITE, UPDATE) reset SSRC lock
  - Called on re-INVITE with SDP to allow new SSRC from SBC
  - Called on hold/resume transitions to handle media renegotiation
  - Clears RTPSuspended state so forwarder is fully active for new stream

### Fixed
- **gosec Security Alerts**: Fixed all remaining security scanner warnings
  - G104: Added explicit error ignoring with `#nosec` comments for cleanup operations
  - G602: Refactored slice access patterns to avoid index bounds warnings

### Technical
- Per-goroutine `G729StreamDecoder` scoped to RTP forwarding lifetime
- Atomic `RTPSuspended` flag for lock-free state checking in hot path
- Port manager tracks recently freed ports with timestamp for cooldown logic
- All changes validated with race detection and memory leak testing
- 50 iterations × 100 packets memory test shows 0 goroutine leaks, 0 MB memory growth

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **G.729 DTX Audio Desync**: Fixed channel audio desync and garbled recordings with G.729 codec
  - DTX (Discontinuous Transmission) silence periods no longer trigger excessive PLC silence insertion
  - Uses RTP timestamp gaps to distinguish real packet loss from DTX silence suppression
  - Reduced maxPLC from 100 packets (2s) to 10 packets (200ms) to prevent recording inflation
  - Fixed sequence tracking for reordered packets to prevent backwards tracking

- **G.729 Decoder Stability**: Added oscillation detection for unstable synthesis filter
  - Detects 2kHz square wave artifacts (>50% railed samples with >25% sign changes)
  - Replaces corrupt decoder output with silence to prevent harsh buzzing/distortion

- **WAV Recording Reliability**: Improved recording file handling
  - WAV files are now finalized on RTP goroutine exit ensuring playable recordings

### Added
- **Buffered STT Pipe**: Replaced unbuffered io.Pipe with buffered pipe (4KB) for STT streaming
  - Decouples RTP handler from STT backpressure to prevent audio processing stalls
  - Non-blocking writes prevent RTP packet loss during temporary STT slowdowns
  - Automatic buffer overflow handling drops oldest data to maintain real-time processing

- **Jitter Buffer**: Added per-leg jitter buffer for RTP packet reordering
  - Reorders out-of-order packets by sequence number before decoding
  - Configurable buffer size (default: 5 packets) and max delay (default: 60ms)
  - Duplicate packet detection and filtering
  - PLC callback for lost packet notification

- **WAV Start-Time Alignment**: Added wall-clock alignment for multi-leg WAV combining
  - Records first RTP packet timestamp for each recording leg
  - `CombineWAVRecordingsAligned()` pads earlier-starting legs with silence
  - Ensures both channels are wall-clock synchronized in stereo output

### Technical
- Track `lastDecodedPCMSize` for accurate PLC silence length calculation
- DTX detection uses 60ms RTP timestamp threshold (3x normal 20ms packet interval)

- **UDP MTU Handling**: Increased UDP MTU to 4096 bytes for large SIPREC messages
  - Combined with compact XML format for maximum efficiency
  - Prevents packet fragmentation issues
- **RFC 7865 Compliance**: Improved SIPREC metadata validation
  - Missing state attribute now treated as warning instead of error
  - Added "unknown" as valid recording state for RFC 7865-only implementations
  - Support for participantsessionassoc elements
  - Enhanced validation distinguishes between RFC 7865 and RFC 7866 requirements
- **Encryption Configuration**: Changed ENCRYPTION_KEY_STORE default from "file" to "memory"
  - Enables out-of-box operation without file path configuration
  - Memory storage suitable for development and testing environments
  - File and vault storage remain available for production use
- **Message Size Optimization**: Compact XML format prevents MTU exceeded errors
  - Changed from indented to compact XML for SIPREC metadata responses
  - Reduces message size by 12-15% to stay within UDP MTU limits
  - Fixes "size of packet larger than MTU" SIP 200 OK response failures

### Fixed
- SIP 200 OK responses failing due to MTU size exceeded on UDP transport
- SIPREC metadata with missing state attribute incorrectly rejected as critical error
- App startup failures when ENCRYPTION_KEY_STORE not configured
- Broken metrics endpoint returning empty data due to uninitialized registry
- Contact headers showing wrong port number in SIP responses

### Notes
- **Remaining Unintegrated Packages**: The following packages are implemented but not yet integrated:
  - `pkg/clustering`: Redis-based multi-instance clustering (requires Redis setup and configuration)
  - `pkg/failover`: Session failover system (depends on clustering infrastructure)
  - `pkg/app`, `pkg/core`, `pkg/util` (legacy): Utility packages with minimal value
  - These packages can be integrated when their specific features are needed
- **Recently Integrated Packages**: pkg/auth, pkg/warnings, and pkg/alerting are now integrated and available for use
